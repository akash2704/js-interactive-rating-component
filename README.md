### What I learned

In the process of working on the Interactive rating component challenge, I learned a lot about JavaScript. Specifically, in the `index.js` file, I learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create interactive elements and handle user interactions.

Some of the key concepts and techniques I learned include:

1. Event handling: I learned how to listen for user events, such as clicks or hover, and respond to them accordingly. This allowed me to implement the hover states for the interactive elements and handle the rating selection.

2. DOM manipulation: I learned how to access and modify elements in the HTML document using JavaScript. This was crucial for updating the UI based on user interactions, such as displaying the "Thank you" card after submitting a rating.

3. Working with classes: I learned how to add and remove CSS classes dynamically using JavaScript. This allowed me to apply different styles to the interactive elements based on their states, such as highlighting the selected rating.

Overall, working on this challenge helped me deepen my understanding of JavaScript and its capabilities for creating interactive web applications. I am excited to continue exploring and applying these concepts in future projects.


### Continued development
I want to continue my learning in javascript specifically and I want to learn more about various JavaScript frameworks
